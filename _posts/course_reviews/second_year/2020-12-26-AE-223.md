**General funda**:

This worked for me (Got a dassi :P)

1. Listen to what sir says in the class very very attentively. Don't worry if you'll fall asleep or not cause sir teaches in a fabulous manner, you can't take your attention off him.
2. Make notes during the class. Listen to his every instruction carefully.
3. Brush up your concepts once before going to the in-class tutorials. Solve them thoroughly even after the tutorial is over. It will help you solidify your concepts for future use
4. Practice the questions uploaded by sir and solve previous year's questions
5. Refer to the book suggested by sir whenever required. (You'll need it rarely though)


**Grading stats**:

**Professor's Teaching Style**: Simply. Awesome.
Among all, Prof K Sinha and Prof AM Pradeep have the best teaching styles in my opinion. He interacted very actively with the students in the class as well as in the tutorials. Was always cheerful when it came to greet everyone or even when he had to wake someone up in the lecture. In overall sense, if you only attend the lectures and tutorials religiously and attentively, then with a few hours in a week apart from all these stuff will land you a comfortable 9 or a 10 grade.


**Should you do this course?**: Core course for aerospace junta, for others it's the basic course you need to do before moving to more advanced stuff in aircraft and rocket propulsion.
