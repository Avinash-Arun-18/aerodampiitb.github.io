**Summary of Project**:
Over the years, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics has gained sig-
nificant popularity in the graphics community for its ability to produce
stunning visual results.
This project is an effort to explore and realize certain algorithms
in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, for the purposes of computer
graphics. We also look into the simulating a dam break problem with
graphics schemes taste of what can be achieved with the discussed
algorithms.
Multiphase flow is a typical phenomenon which widely exists in
nature, engineering applications and produces stunning visual anima-
tions. To capture a lot of interesting visual effects in graphics, it
requires us to model surface tension in our system.
This project is an also effort to implement and explore certain
surface tension models in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics.
This report provides the reader with a brief introduction to Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics a meshfree Lagrangian particle method and
then introduces the reader to the graphics algorithms which are widely
used in SPH. We then introduce few surface tension models commonly
used in SPH literature.
We also look into the simulating certain benchmark test cases com-
monly found in SPH literature to give better clarity about the dis-
cussed models.
