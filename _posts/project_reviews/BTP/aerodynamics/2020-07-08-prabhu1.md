**Project type**: BTP.

**Motivation to pursue project**: Learnt about Fast Multipole Methods in AE625 - Particle Methods for Fluid Flow Simulation. I was very intrigued with the possibility to solve the N body problem in linear time.


**Summary of Project**:
N-body simulation is encountered while solving various problems in the fields ranging from celestial mechanics to molecular dynamics. If the interactions between these N particles are computed directly, this results in a computational cost of O(N2). For large N, these simu- lations become impractical. So, to reduce this computational cost, treecodes were developed. These methods use a tree data structure, which reduces the computational cost to O(N log N ) or O(N) and hence the name. These methods can also be parallelised, thus reducing the com- putational time even more. In this project, treecodes by [Barnes and Hut, 1986], FMM by [Greengard and Rokhlin, 1987] and AFMM developed by [Carrier et al., 1988] are studied and implemented in serial as well as parallel for two-dimensional N-body problems. For 3D, a hybrid of methods developed by [Anderson, 1992] and [Makino, 1999] is implemented, and the results from these algorithms are presented. All the steps in these methods are fully parallel which makes it possible to execute on multi-core CPUs as well as on GPUs. The reduction in time is very significant, and high accuracy can be achieved by choosing the right parameters.
