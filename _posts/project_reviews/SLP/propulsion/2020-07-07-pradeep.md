# Distortion Tolerant Fan Design for Boundary Layer Ingestion Systems
### Ronit Shukla
**Year of Study**: 3rd

**Contact details**: 9923163770

**Project type**: SLP.

**Motivation to pursue project**: I had developed quite an interest in turbomachines through the courses as AE223, AE234 and AE651. Hence I had to explore a bit more in this domain.

**Summary of Project**: The SLP was revolved around literature review of all the major sources of data and testing done in this particular field. Through the SLP, learnings about BLI fluid flow, redesigns required for smooth operations, etc were accomplished.
